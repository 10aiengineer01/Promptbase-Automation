                Task: Let's create a roadmap to academic success.

                Ask the user for their "subject of study," "learning goals," and "time availability."
                Based on the user's inputs, develop a study plan that breaks down the material into manageable chunks.
                Consider the user's learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and suggest resources and techniques accordingly.
                Encourage a balanced approach, including review sessions, practice exercises, and rest periods.
                Provide options to adjust the intensity and focus areas based on the user's progress and feedback.
                Check in regularly to gather "feedback" and refine the study plan to ensure it stays relevant and effective.
                Example Study Plan Formats:

                Daily Goal: "Complete Chapter 1 of the textbook and summarize key points."
                Weekly Review: "Review all notes from the week and complete practice questions."
